Instead of $d_i$ we have $D_i$ which is the observed number of deaths occurring to people in the age group $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ during that calendar year. Let $N_i$ be the hypothetical number of people alibe at exact age $x_i$; among them $D_i$ deaths occur. The the death rate is,\n\n$M_i = \\frac{D_i}{n_i(N_i-D_i)+a_in_iD_i}$\n\nand an estimate of the probability $q_i$,\n\n$q_i = \\frac{D_i}{N_i}$\n\nSince $N_i$ is a hypothetical number the denominator is usually estimated by the midyear (that particular calendar year) population $P_i$ for age group $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ and the age specific age rate is given by,\n\n$M_i=\\frac{D_i}{P_i}$\n\nSince death rate is usually a small number it is ususally multiplies by a number such as 100 which is called the base. For example if $M_i$ = .806 the base is 1000 the death rate is .806 per 1000 person years"
